In this project we will be working with SpaceX launch data that is gathered from an API, specifically the SpaceX REST api. 
This api will give us data about launches, including information about the rocket used, payload delivered, launch specifications, landing specifications and landing outcome.

Our goal is to use this data to predict whether SpaceX will attempt to land a rocket or not.


The final presentation for this project features an executive summary, alongside a more detailed report. This presentation elaborates the data collection process, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, creation of interactive maps using Folium, the dashboard application, and predictive analysis results.
